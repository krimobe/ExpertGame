 \section*{The Expert game - Instructions}
 The \emph{Expert game} is a game played by a group of players. Each player is an expert in one topic (expertise) and needs help of an expert in another topic (question). Players can inquire for help and send replies to inquiries with helpful information.
 You will play a series of \emph{Expert game}s as a group. \textcolor{red}{Each player's expertise and question are randomly reassigned between games.}
  \section*{Goal}
 In each game your goal is to send an \ActionI to your expert and receive a \ActionC from your expert. In each game you first invest \Money{10 kr} but earn \Money{20 kr.}, if you receive a confirmation.
 \section{Rules of the \emph{Expert game}}
\subsection{Question and expertise}
 At the beginning of each game you are assigned a topic you are an expert in (expertise) and a topic you need help with from an expert (question).
 \begin{description}
  \item[Question] You need help from another player who is an expert on your question. There is always exactly one player who is an expert on your question and can help you if you ask him.
  \item[Expertise] You can help other players who need help with your topic of expertise. There is always exactly one player who needs your help and you can help him if he asks you.
 \end{description}
 \subsection{Messages}
 The game consists of a number of rounds. In each round you can send only \textbf{one} message to another player. Messages are delivered and received at the end of each round.
 There are four types of messages: 
 \begin{description}
  \item[\ActionI]  \includegraphics[width=0.05\textwidth]{Send.pdf} An inquiry is a request for help and tells the receiving player your expertise and question. You can send an inquiry to any other player.
  \item[\ActionC] \includegraphics[width=0.05\textwidth]{Confirm.pdf} A confirmation informs the receiving player, that you are his expert and that you will help him. The receiving player earns \Money{20 kr.}. You can only send a confirmation to another player if you know that you are his expert.
 \item[\ActionR] \includegraphics[width=0.05\textwidth]{Refer.pdf} A referral informs the receiving player who his expert is. You can only send a referral to another player if you know who his expert is, but it is not you.
 \item[\ActionN] \includegraphics[width=0.05\textwidth]{Negate.pdf} A negation informs the receiving player that you don't know who his expert is.
 \end{description}
 Because \ActionC, \ActionR and \ActionN require you to know the question of the receiver, you can only send them to players who asked you for help with their question by sending you an \ActionI in a previous round of the game.

 Depending on your information, one of three different types of replies is possible:
   \begin{description}
  \item[\ActionC] \includegraphics[width=0.05\textwidth]{Confirm.pdf} A confirmation informs the receiving player, that you are his expert and that you will help him. The receiving player earns \Money{20 kr.}. You can only send a confirmation to another player if you know that you are his expert.
 \item[\ActionR] \includegraphics[width=0.05\textwidth]{Refer.pdf} A referral informs the receiving player who his expert is. You can only send a referral to another player if you know who his expert is, but it is not you.
 \item[\ActionN] \includegraphics[width=0.05\textwidth]{Negate.pdf} A negation informs the receiving player that you don't know who his expert is.
 \end{description}
 
 \subsection{Earning Money}
